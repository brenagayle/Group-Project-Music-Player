This Music-Player was created during my time in Midland University Code Academy. The goal of this project was to make an application that worked similar to Pandora, Spotify, etc. The final application made it possible to search for any song, save favorites, and create playlists. 

The Music-Player code was created using Visual Stuido Code. 

Languages and frameworks used:

- Angular 6+
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
